Weatherwise is a unique weather app for iOS and Android focused on creative imagery rather than pure data. It replaces large areas of text and boring generic weather icons found in most weather applications with stylized weather scenes with a parallax effect triggered by the accelerometer of the device. The app comes with a Zen Tree weather theme and features other changeable weather themes can be purchased and downloaded from an in-app store. Each theme comes packed with scenes for each weather state(clear, partly cloudy, cloudy, rain, snow, ice,  and fog) as well as alternate scenes for night time and sunset/sunrise. The weather data supplied by the application includes current temperature, 5-day forecast, high and lows, and 3-hourly weather data for the current day. Released in the Summer of 2011, the application has had over 500,000 downloads combined for both iOS and Android platforms.
